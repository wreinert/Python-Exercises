#In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman.
# In the game of Hangman, the player only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.
#Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
#Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed,
# donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
#Optional additions:
#When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
#Rather than telling the user "You have 4 incorrect guesses left", display some picture art for the Hangman.
# This is challenging - do the other parts of the exercise first!
#Your solution will be a lot cleaner if you make use of functions to help you!
